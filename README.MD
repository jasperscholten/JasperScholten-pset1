This app allows the user to alter the appearance of Mr. Potatohead, by altering the state of the switches. In portrait mode, these switches are shown beneath the Potatohead image, whereas in landscape mode, they are shown to the right of the Potatohead image. In the 'doc' folder, three screenshots can be found that show different states for the app: portrait mode, landscape mode, and landscape mode with toggled switches.

The title bar in the app is fixed to the top of the screen. Below that, the Mr. Potatohead view and the switches view are arranged in a vertical stack. In turn, these switch view consists of a horizontal stack of two vertical stacks of switch/label combinations. These switch/label combinations are horizontally stacked.
